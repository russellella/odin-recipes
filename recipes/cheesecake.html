        <h2>Simple, Heavenly Cheesecake</h2>
        <p>Cheesecake can be a little intimidating to attempt, but this recipe makes it simple for anyone! Top it with your favorite fruit, or melt chocolate to drizzle over it. It's easy to make it gluten free - just use gluten free graham crackers for the crust.</p>
        <p><em>Quick tip: Don't ignore the instructions for scraping the edges and letting it sit in the oven for 30 minutes after baking. This will help prevent the cake from cracking.</em></p>
